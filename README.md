**CMS Application**

This repository contains the code for both the frontend and backend components of our project. To run the code locally, follow the instructions below:

**Frontend Setup:**

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. After the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the frontend server.
4. Access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

**Backend Setup:**

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required packages.
3. Once the dependencies are installed, run `node server.js` to start the backend server.
4. The backend server will be hosted at `http://localhost:5000`.

Make sure both the frontend and backend servers are running simultaneously for the full functionality of the application.

For any questions or issues, feel free to contact us.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
